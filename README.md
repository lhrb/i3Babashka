# i3Babashka
Scripts that fetch and output information, written in clojure for [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka). 

The scripts may not run without a tweak on another system but can serve as inspiration.
Some scripts are incomplete and the output may be formatted especially for the use-case (e.g. polybar).
